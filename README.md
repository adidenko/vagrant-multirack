vagrant-k8s
===========
Scripts to:

* Create libvirt lab with multi-rack network topology with Ubuntu 16.04 on the nodes.

Often developer need lab for emulate amount of nodes, located into
defferent racks with no L2 connectivity between racks. Typical scheme is

Into KVM virtual environment this network topology will be implemented as:

![Deployment scheme](img/VENV_multirack.svg?raw=true)


Requirements
------------

* `libvirt`
* `ansible v2.1+`
* `vagrant`
* `vagrant-libvirt` plugin (`vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt`)
* `$USER` should be able to connect to libvirt (test with `virsh list --all`)

Vargant lab preparation
-----------------------

* Change default IP pool for vagrant networks if you want

```bash
export VAGRANT_MR_POOL="10.100.0.0/16"

```

* Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xenolog/vagrant-multirack
cd vagrant-multirack
```

* Prepare the virtual lab

```bash
vagrant up
```

By default will be deployed environmert, contains:

* Master node
* two racks
* two nodes per rack
* virtual TORs implemented as network namespaces into master node VM

You able to re-define following default constants:

* VAGRANT_MR_NAME_SUFFIX -- virtual env name suffix to able deploy different ENVs from one repo.
* VAGRANT_MR_NETWORK_BASE_AS_NUMBER -- AS number of core router and master node
* VAGRANT_MR_NETWORK_PUBLIC -- Public network CIDR
* VAGRANT_MR_NUM_OF_RACKS -- amount of virtual racks
* VAGRANT_MR_RACK{N}_NODES -- specify node amount for rack N
* VAGRANT_MR_NETWORK_RACK{N}_CIDR -- specify CIDR for network inside rack
* VAGRANT_MR_RACK{N}_AS_NUMBER -- specify rack AS number


Deployment Kubernetes on your lab
---------------------------------

* Login to master node and sudo to root

```bash
vagrant ssh $USER-000
sudo su -
```

* Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adidenko/vagrant-k8s ~/mcp
```

* Install required software and pull needed repos

```bash
cd ~/mcp
./bootstrap-master.sh
```

* Set env vars for dynamic inventory

```bash
export INVENTORY=`pwd`/nodes_to_inv.py
export K8S_NODES_FILE=`pwd`/nodes
```

* Check `nodes` list and make sure you have SSH access to them

```bash
cd ~/mcp
cat nodes
ansible all -m ping -i $INVENTORY
```

* Deploy k8s using kargo playbooks

```bash
cd ~/mcp
./deploy-k8s.kargo.sh
```
